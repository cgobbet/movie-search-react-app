# React Movie Search

This is a basic search app using [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org). It has been built using React. Further details will be added here along time. This has been made following the course of James Quick on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/course/greactmovie/enrolled?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=greactmovie_mainlist_launch).

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
